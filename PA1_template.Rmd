## Loading and preprocessing the data
Information regarding the estructu

```{r echo=TRUE}

library(dplyr)
data <- read.csv("data/activity.csv")
# Average (mean) number of steps by date
by_date <- group_by(data,date )
sum_steps <- summarise(by_date,stps=sum(steps))

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(sum_steps$stps, breaks=15)

```

From the histogram, it is clear that the mean equals to `r mean(sum_steps$stps,na.rm=TRUE)` and the median is `r quantile(sum_steps$stps,0.5,na.rm=TRUE)`.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
